Chip load

Here are the suggested chip load ranges based on material and tool diameter. This chart should be used as a starting reference
range only and are based on cutting depth being equal to cutting diameter of the tool.  For deeper cuts, it is necessary to 
reduce the chipload as follows:  
Cut depth 2x Tool Diameter reduce chipload by 20-25%
Cut depth 3x Tool Diameter reduce chipload by 40-50%
