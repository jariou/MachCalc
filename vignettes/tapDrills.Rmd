This vignette presents an overview of the main 
functions implemented in the MachCalc package. 


# Overview

This package was writtent mainly for my own use, but 
I hope others will also find a use for them and let 
me know if they see errors.

# List of main R functions and objects


| Function                      | Summary Description                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bestGearRatio`               | Finds pairs of gears producing ratios close to the one required     |
| `bore3P`                      | Size of the bore of a hole in which 3 given pins fit cotangentially |
| `gearRatio`                   | Support function for *bestGearRatio*
| `linesCircle`                 | Support function for *bore3P*
| `plotCircle`                  | Support function for *bore3P*
| `spindleSpeed`                | Calculates spindle speed


To begin, we'll load **machcalc** and call
the *bestGearRatio* function.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(MachCalc)
bestGearRatio(1.27,100)
```

## `arrange()`: Arrange rows by variables

`dplyr::arrange()` orders the rows of a data frame by the values of one or more columns: 

```{r}
mtcars %>% arrange(cyl, disp)
```

The `desc()` helper allows you to order selected variables in descending order:

```{r}
mtcars %>% arrange(desc(cyl), desc(disp))
```

We can replicate in base R by using `[` with `order()`:

```{r}
mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$disp), , drop = FALSE]
```

Note the use of `drop = FALSE`. If you forget this, and the input is a data frame with a single column, the output will be a vector, not a data frame. This is a source of subtle bugs.

Base R does not provide a convenient and general way to sort individual variables in descending order, so you have two options:

* For numeric variables, you can use `-x`.
* You can request `order()` to sort all variables in descending order.

```{r, results = FALSE}
mtcars[order(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$disp, decreasing = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]
mtcars[order(-mtcars$cyl, -mtcars$disp), , drop = FALSE]
```

## `distinct()`: Select distinct/unique rows

`dplyr::distinct()` selects unique rows:

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = sample(10, 100, rep = TRUE),
  y = sample(10, 100, rep = TRUE)
)
df %>% distinct(x) # selected columns
df %>% distinct(x, .keep_all = TRUE) # whole data frame
```

There are two equivalents in base R, depending on whether you want the whole data frame, or just selected variables:

```{r}
unique(df["x"]) # selected columns
df[!duplicated(df$x), , drop = FALSE] # whole data frame
```

## `filter()`: Return rows with matching conditions

`dplyr::filter()` selects rows where an expression is `TRUE`:

```{r}
starwars %>% filter(species == "Human")
starwars %>% filter(mass > 1000)
starwars %>% filter(hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
```

The closest base equivalent (and the inspiration for `filter()`) is `subset()`:

```{r}
subset(starwars, species == "Human")
subset(starwars, mass > 1000)
subset(starwars, hair_color == "none" & eye_color == "black")
```

You can also use `[` but this also requires the use of `which()` to remove `NA`s:

```{r}
starwars[which(starwars$species == "human"), , drop = FALSE]
starwars[which(starwars$mass > 1000), , drop = FALSE]
starwars[which(starwars$hair_color == "none" & starwars$eye_color == "black"), , drop = FALSE]
```

## `mutate()`: Create or transform variables

`dplyr::mutate()` creates new variables from existing variables:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(z = x + y, z2 = z ^ 2)
```

The closest base equivalent is `transform()`, but note that it cannot use freshly created variables:

```{r}
head(transform(df, z = x + y, z2 = (x + y) ^ 2))
```
Alternatively, you can use `$<-`:

```{r}
mtcars$cyl2 <- mtcars$cyl * 2
mtcars$cyl4 <- mtcars$cyl2 * 2
```

When applied to a grouped data frame, `dplyr::mutate()` computes new variable once per group:

```{r}
gf <- tibble(g = c(1, 1, 2, 2), x = c(0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5))
gf %>% 
  group_by(g) %>% 
  mutate(x_mean = mean(x), x_rank = rank(x))
```

To replicate this in base R, you can use `ave()`:

```{r}
transform(gf, 
  x_mean = ave(x, g, FUN = mean), 
  x_rank = ave(x, g, FUN = rank)
)
```

## `pull()`: Pull out a single variable

`dplyr::pull()` extracts a variable either by name or position:

```{r}
mtcars %>% pull(1)
mtcars %>% pull(cyl)
```

This equivalent to `[[` for positions and `$` for names:

```{r}
mtcars[[1]]
mtcars$cyl
```


## `rename()`: Rename variables by name

`dplyr::rename()` allows you to rename variables by name or position:

```{r}
iris %>% rename(sepal_length = Sepal.Length, sepal_width = 2)
```

Renaming variables by position is straight forward in base R:

```{r}
iris2 <- iris
names(iris2)[2] <- "sepal_width"
```

Renaming variables by name requires a bit more work:

```{r}
names(iris2)[names(iris2) == "Sepal.Length"] <- "sepal_length"
```

Subsetting variables by position is straightforward in base R:

```{r}
iris[1:3] # single argument selects columns; never drops
iris[1:3, , drop = FALSE]
```

You have two options to subset by name:

```{r}
iris[c("Species", "Sepal.Length")]
subset(iris, select = c(Species, Sepal.Length))
```

Subsetting by function of name requires a bit of work with `grep()`:

```{r}
iris[grep("^Petal", names(iris))]
```

And you can use `Filter()` to subset by type:

```{r}
Filter(is.factor, iris)
```

## `summarise()`: Reduce multiple values down to a single value

`dplyr::summarise()` computes one or more summaries for each group:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(disp), n = n())
```

I think the closest base R equivalent uses `by()`. Unfortunately `by()` returns a list of data frames, but you can combine them back together again with `do.call()` and `rbind()`:

```{r}
mtcars_by <- by(mtcars, mtcars$cyl, function(df) {
  with(df, data.frame(cyl = cyl[[1]], mean = mean(disp), n = nrow(df)))
})
do.call(rbind, mtcars_by)
```

`aggregate()` comes very close to providing an elegant answer:

```{r}
agg <- aggregate(disp ~ cyl, mtcars, function(x) c(mean = mean(x), n = length(x)))
agg
```

But unfortunately while it looks like there are `disp.mean` and `disp.n` columns, it's actually a single matrix column:

```{r}
str(agg)
```

You can see a variety of other options at <https://gist.github.com/hadley/c430501804349d382ce90754936ab8ec>, many generated by the R community inspired by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1231252596712771585).

## `slice()`: Choose rows by position

`slice()` selects rows with their location:

```{r}
slice(mtcars, 25:n())
```

This is straightforward to replicate with `[`:

```{r}
mtcars[25:nrow(mtcars), , drop = FALSE]
```

# Two-table verbs

When we want to merge two data frames, `x` and `y`), we have a variety of different ways to bring them together. Various base R `merge()` calls are replaced by a variety of dplyr `join()` functions.

| dplyr                  | base                                    |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `inner_join(df1, df2)` |`merge(df1, df2)`                        | 
| `left_join(df1, df2) ` |`merge(df1, df2, all.x = TRUE)`          | 
| `right_join(df1, df2)` |`merge(df1, df2, all.y = TRUE)`          | 
| `full_join(df1, df2)`  |`merge(df1, df2, all = TRUE)`            | 
| `semi_join(df1, df2)`  |`df1[df1xx, , drop = FALSE]`  | 
| `anti_join(df1, df2)`  |`df1[!df1xx, , drop = FALSE]` | 

For more information about two-table verbs, see `vignette("two-table")`.

### Mutating joins

dplyr's `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`, and `full_join()` add new columns from `y` to `x`, matching rows based on a set of "keys", and differ only in how missing matches are handled. They are equivalent to calls to `merge()` with various settings of the `all`, `all.x`, and `all.y` arguments. The main difference is the order of the rows:

* dplyr preserves the order of the `x` data frame.
* `merge()` sorts the key columns.

### Filtering joins

dplyr's `semi_join()` and `anti_join()` affect only the rows, not the columns:

```{r}
band_members %>% semi_join(band_instruments)
band_members %>% anti_join(band_instruments)
```

They can be replicated in base R with `[` and `%in%`:

```{r}
band_members[band_members$name %in% band_instruments$name, , drop = FALSE]
band_members[!band_members$name %in% band_instruments$name, , drop = FALSE]
```

Semi and anti joins with multiple key variables are considerably more challenging to implement.
